This is a *Flask + Spyne* working together example. It is very simple, absolutely sinthetic and does nothing useful. Again, it's just an example.

## Installation

Clone repository, create virtualenv and install requirements:

    pip install -r requerements.txt
    
## Usage

Run Flask web server using `./manage.py`. Try some Flask views to make shure it works.
